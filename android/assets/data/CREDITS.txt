Get a life!  Stop watching the credits!




















Sitting too close to the TV really is bad for you...















...unless you turn it off...



















A car is not a toy...



















...unless it's really, really fast and expensive...



















Four out of five people surveyed will believe just about anything...















I think that the problem with this video is that it is highly derivative
of many popular bands within the genre... 
Although if viewed on its own merit, it does have a decent groove... 
But what it has in groove, it lacks in originality... 
One can't help but be reminded of bands such as Pearl Jam, White Zombie, 
Suicidal Tendencies, and other bands that bear the mantle 
of society's alternative rock... 
One can't help but be reminded of Lori Anderson when she wore curlers... 
Mheh heh heh... 
This video speak less to the mind, and more to the sphincter ... 
In closing, I think Korn would do well to <SMACK-SMACK-SMACK> AAHHHhh!






























Monolith Productions is dedicated to making great games...so be on the lookout for more addictive gameplay from Monolith...
